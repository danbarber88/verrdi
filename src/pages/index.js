      <h1>Driver CPC Training</h1>
      <SubHeader>Yorkshire & Lincolnshire</SubHeader>
      <Header2>What is Driver CPC?</Header2>
      <p>
        The most important thing to know is that professional bus, coach and
        lorry drivers (vehicles over 3.5t) are now required to hold a Driver CPC
        (Certificate of Professional Competence) licence in addition to a
        vocational driving licence. So whether youâ€™re coming into the industry
        new, are an existing driver or are responsible for a fleet of drivers,
        it is imperative that you are aware of how to comply with Driver CPC
        legislation and the correct licensing of drivers.
      </p>
      <Header2>Why choose Verrdi?</Header2>
      <p>
        Here at Verrdi we want to make your Driver CPC course to be as a
        pleasurable experience as we possibly can. Whilst we understand these
        courses may be met with some frustration it is as we know a necessity to
        continue your periodic vocational training to allow you to drive
        commercially.
      </p>
      <p>
        As ex-drivers ourselves we know that, you as an experienced driver will
        know the subjects we are required to cover, but there may well be things
        you have forgotten over time and all we want to do is refresh
        information you already know, in a light hearted, respectful and
        conversational style. Whereby everyone gets an opportunity to add
        valuable input into the sessions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Driver CPC training courses will be offered in a variety of comfortable
        locations across Yorkshire & Lincolnshire, offering you the convenience
        to train with us at a place and time to suite you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Periodic CPC Training is usually delivered in 7 hour blocks to offer
        flexibility around your already busy work schedule, which then has to be
        balanced with your precious family time.
